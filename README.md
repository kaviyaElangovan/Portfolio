## Projects
### Gold Price Prediction
[Publication](https://github.com/kaviyaElangovan/project/blob/main/Gold%20price%20predication%20in%20India.ipynb)

Developed a machine learning model to forecast gold prices using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters. The model incorporated financial indicators such as USD/INR exchange rates, interest rates, and market trends. The implementation included data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring high predictive accuracy.Key Impact: Provided investors and analysts with a data-driven decision-making tool, enhancing financial planning and risk assessment.

### House Price Prediction
[Publication](https://github.com/kaviyaElangovan/project/blob/main/House%20Price%20Predicition%20.ipynb)

Built a predictive model leveraging Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to estimate house prices based on location, size, and market trends. The project involved data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values), feature engineering (extracting key attributes), and exploratory data analysis (visualizing trends and correlations). Hyperparameter tuning improved model accuracy and robustness.Key Impact: Enabled homebuyers and investors to make informed real estate decisions by providing reliable price estimations based on historical and real-time data.

### Brain Tumor Classification
[Publication](https://github.com/kaviyaElangovan/project/blob/main/brain-tumor.ipynb)

Implemented a CNN-based deep learning model for brain tumor classification using MRI scans. The approach included image preprocessing (resizing, normalization), data augmentation, and feature extraction using CNN layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten). Model performance was enhanced with hyperparameter tuning and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.Key Impact: Assisted doctors and radiologists in early tumor detection, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling timely treatment interventions.
